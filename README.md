### Reader Fonts

The default fonts have been replaced with Lexend Deca and Bitter. These fonts have been chosen specifically to improve reading fluency and e-ink performance. These 'sturdier' typefaces feature uniform stroke weights and open geometries, allowing the X4/X3 to render crisp, high-contrast text with font-aliasing on while significantly reducing ghosting and artifacts.

- [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca) - A research-backed sans-serif typeface designed to improve reading fluency. Lexend was engineered based on the theory that reading issues are often a design problem (visual crowding) rather than a cognitive one.
- [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) - A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on digital screens. The consistent stroke weight of Bitter helps it render particularly well on e-ink devices. The medium weight has been chosen specifically for improved rendering on the X4/X3.

The UI now uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the display font which has improved readability at smaller sizes.

### Music and Supplemental Glyphs

- Built-in reader fonts include music notation, selected Cyrillic glyphs, and the Project Hail Mary CJK fallback ranges. Additional SD-card fonts retain emoji fallback support.

## Tips for the best reading experience

CrossInk runs on an ESP32-C3 with limited RAM, so very large folders or complex EPUBs can be slower than they would be on a phone, tablet, or desktop app.

- Keep folders under about 200 files. For the smoothest browsing, aim for 50-100 files per folder.
- Having 1000+ books on the SD card is fine if they are split into smaller folders, such as by author, series, genre, or read/unread status.
- Avoid putting every book in the SD card root. The file browser has to scan and sort the current folder before it can show it.
- Text-first EPUBs are the best fit. Large image-heavy EPUBs, scanned books, comics, and omnibus files with thousands of sections may load slowly or fail under memory pressure.
- As a rough target, EPUBs under 20 MB tend to work the best. Files over 50 MB may still work, but they are more likely to be slow or memory-sensitive, especially if they contain many large images.
- If an EPUB is unusually slow, try [optimizing](./docs/webserver.md#epub-optimization) it with the built-in web optimizer (via File Transfer) before copying it to the SD card: remove unused high-resolution images, split very large omnibus files, and avoid embedding multiple full font families when possible.
- Use a reliable SD card and leave some free space. CrossInk stores settings, reading progress, cache files, stats, and generated book data on the card.
